<body>
    <div>
        Which is not going to be delivered in straight up camelCase
        <div>
            If you are interested in more on this journey into HTML (etc)...
        </div>
        <div>
            then you probably want to start with <a href="camelCase.html">camelCase.html</a>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="class01">
        But, bear in mind that this is being produced while I'm new... note the blue/orange combo (that is still not
        what I wanted) and ask yourself 'do I have much to learn, here ?'
    </div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            And now, here's a new font.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, it probably makes a lot more sense to go and inspect other better styled webpages...

        </p>
        <p>
            Although, they probably won't have nice collages of insects - so like bear that in mind
            while you do...
        </p>

        Anyway, I think that's enough experimenting with styling, for now.
    </div>
    <p>
        If you'd like to see where this goes next, with these
        stylings as standard (probably without the orange & blue) then maybe check out the <a
            href="about.html">ABOUT</a>
        page... stuff is still being added thick and fast... you'll know when this is a more mature and slower growing
        website when there's menu bars and navigation and stuff...
    </p>

    <div>
        Or if not, then... maybe have a look at <a href="./jpegs/latestCollage.jpg">Collage.jpg</a> for the latest
        collage on your way out ? or just EXIT according to any other method you know..
    </div>
