<body>
    <div>
        Which is not going to be delivered in straight up camelCase
        <div>
            If you are interested in more on this journey into HTML (etc)...
        </div>
        <div>
            ...then you probably want to start with <a href="camelCase.html">camelCase.html</a>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="class01">
        But, bear in mind that this is being produced while I'm pretty new here... which is probably why the tasteful
        blue/orange combo seemed like something to try out...
    </div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            And now this new font...
        </p>
        <p>
            So, it probably makes a lot more sense to go and inspect other better styled webpages.

        </p>
        <p>
            Although - they probably won't have nice wall art of flies on chicken poo - so just like bear that in mind
            while you do...
        </p>

        Anyway, I think that's enough experimenting done with this styling stuff, for now.
    </div>
    <p>
        If you'd like to see where this goes next, with these
        stylings as standard (prolly without the orange&blue) then, visit the <a href="about.html">ABOUT</a>
        page, as
        the next port of call...
    </p>

    <div>
        Or if not, then... maybe have a look at <a href="./jpegs/latestCollage.jpg">Collage.jpg</a> for a
        collage of brightly
        coloured dungflies? or back out again according to any other recipe that works...
