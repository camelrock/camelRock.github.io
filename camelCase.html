            If they're NamingThings, or TALKINGamongTHEMSELVES
        </p>
        <div>
            But... that ain't camelCase
        </div>
        <div>
            and... also... it's probably best to stick with what we're more used to...
        </div>
        <p>
            But, in 2023, computers still struggle sometimes with spaces in the names of things...

        <div>
            mmm... bored yet? <a href="recipefile.html">recipeFile.html</a>
            < NB : there shouldn't really be fullstops in camelCase </div>
                <p>
                    and camelCase is one way of writingWithoutSpaces that means you only need to remember the words,
                    each time
                    you type a string of words (eg 'theFileThatNeedsToBeCopied') - you don't need to remember which
                    words were
                    capitalised (sure you've been a bit unsure exactly how yo're supposed to type your password, at
                    least one
                    time)... and you can also cut down on keys typed, by using it.. so basically it's super
                    straightforward to
                    make sure you type exactly the same you did last time...
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                So that's 'camelCase' - which I brought up because I named the other HTML document 'HomePage'
            </p>
            <div>
                Realizing now that I haven't actually defined 'camelCase'... basically, the first word is all in
                lowercase,
                with
                all subsequent words having an UPPERCASE first letter and any further letters being lowercase - eg :
                camelCase.
            </div>
            <p>
                so 'HomePage' is <strong>almost</strong> regular camelCase
            </p>
            <p>
                but if you look carefully, it starts with an UPPERCASE letter - which
                basically means it isn't
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                That style is in fact called 'PascalCase' - or sometimes 'upperCamelCase' (I'm guessing the term
                '<strong>U</strong>pperCamelCase' is a bit like saying "soccer" outside the United States of America)
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like with human languages (or at least, with English) - using an UPPERCASE letter can change the
                meaning of a
                word
            </p>
            <p>
                eg : 'mark' may mean a persistent splodge,
            </p>
            <p>
                but 'Mark' (in the middle of a sentence)
                might refer instead to a good mate... although of course, most of the time we have the perspective to
                not be
                derailed when we
                encounter spelling mistakes
            </p>
            <p>

                If you get more into computer programming, you'll have better excuses to use some of
                these.. and, backing up
                a bit... if you're new to HTML etc (and interested in learning how to use it) then, at this
                point : it might
                be a good idea to google 'developer tools' so you can start to get into finding out how this and other
                websites
                were constructed
            </p>
            <div>
                But ONLY if you ARE interested, AND do NOT EXPECT to be learning anything too hot by imitating what was
                seen
                today on this here webpage...
